## Hi there! I'm Andy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year Computer Science Student currently attending UC San Diego. I started out doing game development and Robotics, then pivoted to exploring Web Development and Natural Language Processing.  

- I worked with the Qualcomm Institute to create metahuman Avatars for interactive learning by fine tune a Llama3 Model to expand emotion tagging datasets and speak like historical figures.
