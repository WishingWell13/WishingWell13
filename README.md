## Hi there! I'm Andy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year Computer Science Student currently attending UC San Diego. I started out doing game development and Robotics, then pivoted to exploring Web Development and Natural Language Processing.  



#### Natural Language Processing
- I worked with Ujima S&P to produce a paper analyzing Reddit threads surrounding child saftey on Roblox using Natural Language Processing techniques.
- I worked with the Qualcomm Institute to create metahuman Avatars for interactive learning by fine tune a Llama3 Model to expand emotion tagging datasets and speak like historical figures.

#### Web Development
- I developed a webiste for Ujima S&P cataloging resources for social and cultural impacts of computing using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- At the [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) at UCSD](https://acmucsd.com), I developed the store item page and various Admin pages for [Portal V2](https://github.com/acmucsd/membership-portal-ui-v2), servicing 5000+ total users.
