## Hi there! I'm Andy 👋

I'm a third year Computer Science Student currently attending UC San Diego. I started out doing game development and Robotics, then pivoted to exploring Web Development and Natural Language Processing.  

### 🔭 I’m currently working on

- I'm developing a webiste for [Ujima S&P](https://sites.google.com/view/ujima-sp-lab/home?authuser=0) cataloging resources for social and cultural impacts of computing using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### 🕰️ I previously was working on

#### Natural Language Processing
- I worked with [Ujima S&P](https://sites.google.com/view/ujima-sp-lab/home?authuser=0) to produce a paper analyzing Reddit threads surrounding child saftey on Roblox using Python scripts employing Pandas, webscraping, and Natural Language Processing techniques.
- I worked with the [Qualcomm Institute](https://qi.ucsd.edu/) to create metahuman Avatars for interactive learning by fine tune a Llama3 Model using LlamaFactory to expand emotion tagging datasets and speak like historical figures.

#### Web Development
- At the [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) at UCSD](https://acmucsd.com), I developed the store item page and various Admin pages for [Portal V2](https://github.com/acmucsd/membership-portal-ui-v2) using NextJS and SCSS, servicing 5000+ total users.


#### Game Development 
- I was part of the team that developed [Andy's Donuts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/andys-donuts/id1551910340) for the Apple App Store, using the Unity Game Engine.
- Other games I've helped develop can be found on my [itch.io](https://wishingwell13.itch.io/) page. Two won awards in the Congressional App Challenge!
