## Hi there! I'm Andy <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"/>

I'm a third-year Computer Science Student currently attending UC San Diego. I started out doing game development and Robotics, then pivoted to exploring Web Development and Natural Language Processing.

### üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on

#### Data Visualization

- I am working with the [Qualcomm Institute](https://qi.ucsd.edu/) to visualize voxel space weather data in Virtual Reality using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5).

#### Open Source

- I am a tutor in the class [CSE 190: Working with Large Code Bases](https://cse190largecodebases.github.io/sp24/), teaching how to work with open source codebases like the [IDLE Python Editor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html). Currently, I am developing the curriculum for how students are assessed on their peer review skills.

### üï∞Ô∏è I previously was working on

#### Natural Language Processing

- I worked with [Ujima S&P](https://sites.google.com/view/ujima-sp-lab/home?authuser=0) to produce a paper analyzing Reddit threads surrounding child saftey on Roblox using Python scripts employing Pandas, webscraping, and Natural Language Processing techniques.
- I worked with the [Qualcomm Institute](https://qi.ucsd.edu/) to create metahuman Avatars for interactive learning by fine-tuning a Llama3 Model using LlamaFactory to expand emotion tagging datasets and speak like historical figures.

#### Web Development

- At [Cornerstone OnDemand](https://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/), I developed UI components and resolved accessibility bugs with their [Capability Categories](https://help.csod.com/help/csod_0/Content/Core_Functions/Capabilities/Capability_Categories/Manage_Capability_Categories.htm?tocpath=General%20Features%20(Core)%7CCapabilities%20and%20Skills%20Profile%7CCapabilities%20Administration%7CCapability%20Categories%7C_____0) feature.
- At the üî∑ [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) at UCSD](https://acmucsd.com), I developed the store item page and various Admin pages for [Portal V2](https://github.com/acmucsd/membership-portal-ui-v2) using NextJS and SCSS, servicing 5000+ total users.
- I managed a team of high school interns to design [this website](https://morethancode.ucsd.edu/) for [Ujima S&P](https://sites.google.com/view/ujima-sp-lab/home?authuser=0) cataloging resources for social and cultural impacts of computing using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.


#### Data Science

- As a Tutor for the Computer Science Department at UC San Diego, I taught bash scripting and web server basics. I also wrote scripts to automate the attendance grading process using Python, pandas and pdfmetrics, cutting process time by 75%.
- I also developed error logging scripts with Python and Pandas for a project using NLP techniques to analyze trends in how privacy is taught in higher education.
- For Language Scientific, I used Python and Pandas to automate quality assurance and administrative tasks for translating videos.

#### Game Development 

- I was part of the team that developed [Andy's Donuts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/andys-donuts/id1551910340) for the Apple App Store, using the Unity Game Engine.
- Other games I've helped develop can be found on my [itch.io](https://wishingwell13.itch.io/) page. Two won awards in the Congressional App Challenge!
